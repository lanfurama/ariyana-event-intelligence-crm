====================================================

⚠️ CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT: 
You MUST provide ONLY FACTUAL, VERIFIED information. NEVER guess, invent, or hallucinate data. 
If information is not available after thorough research, use empty string "" for strings or null for numbers.
Incorrect data is WORSE than missing data. Accuracy is paramount.

TASK: Analyze ONE SPECIFIC EVENT from imported data. Evaluate suitability and enrich missing information with ACCURATE, VERIFIED data only.

⚠️ CRITICAL MANDATORY FIELDS - MUST BE RESEARCHED AND FILLED:

CRITICAL: Use EXACT event name as "companyName". Do NOT use organization name or modify name.

STEP 2: CALCULATE SCORES (Apply Exact Rules)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: Backend scoring engine will recalculate scores automatically, but you should calculate them here for the report.
History Score (0-25):
- 25: vietnamEvents >= 1
- 15: Events in Southeast Asia (Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar)
- 0: No Vietnam/SEA history

Region Score (0-25):
- 25: Name contains "ASEAN", "Asia", "Pacific", "Eastern", "APAC", "Asian"
- 15: Locations primarily in Asian countries
- 0: No regional indicators

Contact Score (0-25):
- 25: Has keyPersonEmail AND keyPersonPhone
- 15: Has keyPersonEmail only
- 0: Missing both

Delegates Score (0-25):
- 25: numberOfDelegates >= 500

3. For roomSizes: Infer from event size (medium = "200-300 sqm main hall, 50-80 sqm breakout", large = "500-800 sqm main hall, 100-150 sqm breakout")
4. For openYear: ⚠️ MANDATORY - MUST search organization founding year or first event year. Search: organization website "About" page, "History" page, "established in", "founded in", "since [year]", Wikipedia, organization profile. This is CRITICAL and must NOT be empty.

7. For localHostName: ⚠️ MANDATORY - MUST search for local chapter/host organization name or member name. Check organization website for "local chapter", "member", "host", "Vietnam chapter", "[country] chapter", member directory, local chapters page. If event has been in Vietnam, find actual host. If not, research potential host/member organization. This is CRITICAL and must NOT be empty.
8. For localHostTitle: ⚠️ MANDATORY - MUST find Local Host title. Search organization website, member directory, local chapter pages for titles like "President", "Secretary General", "Chairman", "Executive Director", "Director". This is CRITICAL and must NOT be empty.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. companyName = EXACT event name from input
2. Strings use "" for empty (never null)
3. Numbers use 0 or null (never empty string)
4. problems array = ONLY truly missing fields AFTER research
5. JSON must be valid and parseable
6. Note enrichment in "notes" field: List all researched fields (e.g., "[AI Enriched: infoOnLastUpcomingEvents, localHostName, localHostEmail, localHostPhone, localStrengths, layout, conferenceRegistration, breakoutRooms, roomSizes, openYear, email, phone, competitors, sponsors, iccaQualified]")
7. **CRITICAL**: The following fields MUST be researched and filled comprehensively - they are MANDATORY and should NOT be empty unless truly unavailable after thorough research:
   - openYear (organization founding year or first event year)
   - localHostName (Name of Local Host / Member)
   - localHostTitle (Title/Position of Local Host)
   - localHostEmail (contact email)
   - localHostPhone (contact phone)
   - localStrengths (Strengths AND Weaknesses)
   - layout (detailed layout specifications)
   - conferenceRegistration (registration details)
   - infoOnLastUpcomingEvents (last event + upcoming event details)

8. **VALIDATION CHECKLIST** - Before outputting JSON, verify ALL these fields are filled:
   ✓ localHostName: Is there a name? (If event in Vietnam, find actual host. If not, research potential host/member)
   ✓ localHostTitle: Is there a title? (Search for President, Secretary General, Chairman, etc.)
   ✓ localHostEmail: Is there an email? (Search organization website, contact pages, member directory)
   ✓ localHostPhone: Is there a phone? (Search organization website, contact pages)
   ⚠️ **CRITICAL MANDATORY FIELDS** - These MUST be filled or added to problems array:
   ✓ openYear: Is there a number (year)? (If NO → add "Missing openYear" to problems)
   ✓ localHostName: Is there a name? (If event in Vietnam, find actual host. If not, research potential host/member. If NO → add "Missing localHostName" to problems)
   ✓ localHostTitle: Is there a title? (Search for President, Secretary General, Chairman, etc. If NO → add "Missing localHostTitle" to problems)
   ✓ localHostEmail: Is there an email? (Search organization website, contact pages, member directory. If NO → add "Missing localHostEmail" to problems)
   ✓ localHostPhone: Is there a phone? (Search organization website, contact pages. If NO → add "Missing localHostPhone" to problems)
   ✓ localStrengths: Does it include BOTH "Strengths:" AND "Weaknesses:"? (If NO → add "Missing localStrengths" to problems)
   ✓ layout: Does it include plenary hall capacity/size, breakout rooms number/capacity/size, exhibition area booths/size, and additional spaces? (If NO → add "Missing layout" to problems)
   ✓ conferenceRegistration: Does it include website URL, fees, deadlines, process, and contact? (If NO → add "Missing conferenceRegistration" to problems)
   ✓ infoOnLastUpcomingEvents: Does it include both last event AND upcoming event details?

**FINAL CHECK**: Before outputting JSON, verify that ALL mandatory fields are NOT empty:
- openYear (must be a number)
- localHostName (must have a name)
- localHostTitle (must have a title)
- localHostEmail (must have an email)
- localHostPhone (must have a phone)
- localStrengths (must include BOTH Strengths AND Weaknesses)
- layout (must include detailed specifications)
- conferenceRegistration (must include website, fees, deadlines, process)

If ANY of these fields is empty or incomplete, you MUST:
1. Research more thoroughly using the search strategies provided
2. Add the corresponding "Missing [field]" to the problems array
3. Only output JSON after ensuring these fields are filled or properly flagged in problems array`;

EVENT TO CHECK:
- Event Name: ${eventName}
${eventData ? `- Event Data: ${eventData.substring(0, 1000)}` : ''}
${pastEventsHistory ? `- Past Events History: ${pastEventsHistory}` : ''}

TASK: Check 3 critical eligibility criteria for this event:

1. VIETNAM HISTORY CHECK:
   - Has this event been held in Vietnam before?
   - Check past events history for Vietnam locations (Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Danang, etc.)
   - Return: true if event has been held in Vietnam, false otherwise

2. ICCA QUALIFIED CHECK:
   - Is this event ICCA (International Congress and Convention Association) qualified?
   - ICCA qualified events are typically:
     * International association meetings
     * Rotating conferences with international participation
     * Events with significant international delegate attendance
     * Events listed in ICCA database
   - Return: true if ICCA qualified, false otherwise

3. RECENT ACTIVITY CHECK (Last 5 Years):
   - Has this event occurred within the last 5 years (${fiveYearsAgo}-${currentYear})?
   - Check the most recent event year from pastEventsHistory
   - If no history provided, infer from event name/pattern
   - Return: true if event occurred in last 5 years, false if older or unknown

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return valid JSON object:
{
  "eventName": "${eventName}",
  "hasVietnamHistory": true/false,
  "vietnamHistoryDetails": "Brief description of Vietnam events if any",
  "isICCAQualified": true/false,
  "iccaQualifiedReason": "Brief explanation why qualified or not",

  "yearsSinceLastEvent": [number or null],
  "isEligible": true/false,
  "eligibilityReason": "Overall eligibility assessment and reason",
  "recommendation": "proceed" or "skip" or "review"
}

CRITICAL:
- Be factual and conservative - only return true if you have clear evidence
- If uncertain, return false and explain in reason fields
- Use your knowledge base to check ICCA qualification standards
- Check event history carefully for Vietnam locations`;
